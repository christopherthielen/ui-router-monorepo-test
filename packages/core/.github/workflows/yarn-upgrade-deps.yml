# This workflow requires an SSH key.
# Create an SSH key pair with no passphrase using:
#
# ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
#
# Then create a deploy key called SSH_PUBLIC_KEY and grant it write access.
# e.g., https://github.com/ui-router/core/settings/keys
# Then create a repo secret called SSH_PRIVATE_KEY
# e.g., https://github.com/ui-router/core/settings/secrets
